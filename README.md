# Data-Mining

This is my assignments of Data Mining at Columbia Universtiy.  

The class is roughly divided into two parts: 
1. programming best practices, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and unsupervised learning 
2. supervised learning including regression and classification methods 

In the first part of the course we will focus writing R programs in the context of simulations, data wrangling, and EDA. Unsupervised learning is focused on problems where the outcome variable is not known and the goal of the analysis is to find hidden structure in data such as different market segments from buying patterns or human population structure from genetics data. Supervised learning deals with prediction problems where the outcome variable is known such as predicting a price of a house in a certain neighborhood or an outcome of a congressional race.

The Assignment 1 focuses on:

Data structures
Hadley Wickhamâ€™s R style
Manipulating data
American National Election Study
